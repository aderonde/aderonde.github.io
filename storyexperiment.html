        Suddenly, you are awake. The sheets are your own, as is the bed, and the ceiling; all your limbs are in order.

        What woke you up, I wonder?

        You roll over, and on your bedside table (old) a digital alarm clock glows green. You did not buy the clock. You are not seventy--or, however old someone must be to buy a digital alarm clock. It came with the house.

        It is 2:55 AM.

      	 You roll over, knocking your alarm clock off the bedside table, facedown. Your room is soft and blue. You walk, barefoot over the bare floor, to the window, and twist the twisty thing that opens the blinds.

      	 Outside, the only light comes from the streetlamp at the edge of your yard, yellowish orange. The sky is clear of clouds.
