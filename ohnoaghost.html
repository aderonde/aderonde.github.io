        Suddenly, you are awake. The sheets are your own, as is the bed, and the ceiling; all your limbs are in order.

        What woke you up, I wonder?

    <section id="001">
        You roll over, and on your bedside table (old) a digital alarm clock glows green. You did not buy the clock. You are not seventy--or, however old someone must be to buy a digital alarm clock. It came with the house.

        It is 2:55 AM.

    <section id="002">
         You roll over, knocking your alarm clock off the bedside table, facedown. Your room is soft and blue. You walk, barefoot over the bare floor, to the window, and twist the twisty thing that opens the blinds.

         Outside, the only light comes from the streetlamp at the edge of your yard, yellowish orange. The sky is clear of clouds.

        You hear rain outside, soft. You stare at the wall, bare of pictures even after a year here, and concentrate. It is hard, when you are sleepy. Finally, you hear the soft scrape of a chair in the kitchen.

    <section id="004">
        You flick the light on in your bathroom.

        It remains dark. A circuit blown in the storm?

    <section id="006">
        You stare at the pale pink walls, waiting.

        You hold your breath.

        You hear the quiet click of glass, across the house.

    <section id="005">
        You walk down the dark hallway, footsteps silent on the carpet. Peering into the living room, you can see the lumpy shape of the couch, and the upturned crate that serves as a table.

        No point, really, in having more. Who would you be impressing?

    <section id="007">
        You crouch down on the carpet, lay down to peer beneath the couch. Broken glass winks back at you. It looks as though it was swept out of sight.

         <a href="#008">Onward to kitchen</a>
    </section>

    <section id="008">
        Your bare feet are cold on the kitchen tiles. The curtains blow in the wind, speckled with rain, though you don't remember leaving them open.

        Strangely, you can't hear the rain here.

         <a href="#009">"Hello?"</a>  <a href="#010">"Get the hell out here."</a>
    </section>


            <section id="009">
                "Hello?" you say, your voice a shock in the still kitchen. "Is anyone there?"

                Something rustles behind the pantry door.

                <a href="#012">"Listen, this is my house."</a> <a href="#010">"Get the hell out here."</a>
             </section>

            <section id="012">
                "Listen, this is my house," you say, holding up your hands, though no one is in evidence.

                Your palms sweat in the cool, still air.

                A soft yellow light shines from under the pantry door. The door clicks open, and something strange and un-solid drifts out: the suggestion of a body, made of clouds and light.

                "I didn't mean to scare you," it says.

                <a href="#014">"What did you mean to do, then?"</a> <a href="#010">"Get the hell out here."</a>

             <section id="014">
                 "What did you mean to do, then?"

                 As much as a ghost can look much of anything, it appears sheepish. "The house seemed," it glances at the kitchen, empty of furniture, "abandoned. Good spot for a ghost to set up, if it doesn't want to cause any problems."

                 The ghost's smile is odd, more like a lantern shutter opening, revealing light, than any movement of teeth or muscles.

                 "It seems I was wrong, however," the ghost continues. "My apologies."

                  <a href="#015">"You don't want to haunt someone?"</a> <a href="#010">"Apology not accepted. Get out."</a>  <a href="#016">"What's with all the broken glass, then?"</a>

             <section id="015">
                 "Not all ghosts want to be all, you know, wooOOOOOooooOOO."

                 You've never heard a worse ghost noise, in all your life. You say so.

                 The ghost seems to shrug. "I don't like scaring people. It's not a very satisfying after-life, making people miserable."

                 <a href="#010">Get the hell out of here.</a>  <a href="#016">"What's with all the broken glass, then?"</a>

                "What's with all the broken glass, then?"

                "Oh." The ghost shrinks a bit, drifting closer to the floor. There is a sound like marbles jostling in a cup. You realize the ghost is clearing its throat. "Um. I got...scared. The storm. And all. Sometimes telekinesis is hard to control."

                <a href="#017">"You're afraid of storms? Can I do anything?"</a> <a href="#010">"Right. Get out, then."</a>

             <section id="017">
                 "You're afraid of storms? Can I do anything?"

                 The ghost's light grows warmer, edging into pink. "Oh no! I--I couldn't. Just a place to stay is lovely, if you don't mind."

                 <a href="#025">"Well, you can't stay here. Shoo."</a> <a href="#018">"Sure, you can stay in here. Night."</a> <a href="#019">"Nonsense. Do ghosts drink tea?"</a>

                 "Well, you can't stay here. Shoo."

                 "Oh, of course," the ghost stammers. "Sorry again." The ghost dims to nothing more than the flicker of a candle, and disappears. You hear the rain again, hammering quietly and insistently on your windows.

                 You turn, and walk back through your living room, down the hallway to your room, where you sleep until morning.

                 In the daylight, your house is empty again. The glass under the sofa has been cleared.

                 The ghosts drifts closer, seeming perhaps to blink at you. "I'm not sure. I've never tried. I...could give it a shot, I guess." From this close, you can tell that the ghost radiates a small bit of warmth, like a candle flame. "Do you drink tea, when you get scared?"

                 <a href="#020">"Sometimes, yeah." Make tea.</a><a href="#021">"I don't get scared." Make tea.</a>

                 "I don't get scared," you say, and busy yourself making tea.

                 "Oh," the ghost says, hovering near the pantry, and says nothing else.

                 The tea is done quickly, the scent of mint and herbs floating around the kitchen. There are no chairs here, so you take two mugs into the living room and set them on your makeshift coffee table.

                 "Thanks," the ghost says quietly.

                 <a href="#022">"Actually...I do get scared. This helps, though."</a> <a href="#023">"Right, well. Enjoy. Night."</a>

                 "Sometimes, yeah." You busy yourself making the tea, the ghost floating behind you with apparent interest. Although you can barely hear the rain, here, the ghost flinches with every flash of lightning. 

                 You begin to explain how the tea kettle works, and when the water is hot, you carry two mugs into the living room. The ghost hovers next to you on the threadbare couch.

                 The ghost's blurry arm cups its mug, and it tries a sip, glowing instantly brighter--a pure yellow diffusing the room. "Wow that is...huh. Warm," it says. "Thank you."

                 You ask it about ghost things, and it asks you about why you have an upside down crate as a table. The ghost, you learn, is fond of puns, and can speak Latin, although it won't say where it learned. You talk long after you finish your tea, until the storm subsides, just before dawn.

                 The ghost sighs in relief. "Thank you so much. I've always hated storms."

                 <a href="#026">"You're welcome. Maybe I'll see you around?"</a>  <a href="#027">"You're welcome. Listen, are you...still looking for a semi-abandoned place to haunt?"</a>

                "Maybe," the ghost says, and tentatively reaches out a warm arm to pat you on the shoulder. "You've been very kind. I'll make sure the other ghosts know to leave you alone."

                The ghost bobs its head, and the glass drifts out from under the sofa, reassembling into a small cup before the ghost sets it on the table. Then it grins at you one last time, before fading into the dawn.

                 The ghost seems surprised by this, glowing redder. On the table, the mugs rattle a bit. "It would be nice, to have some place," it says, at length, looking away from you.

                 "How about here?"

                 "Here?" It's flame-bright face turns to peer at you. "Are you...Are you sure? I wouldn't want to impose."

"Ghost roommates are very low maintenence. I could even water your plants, if you wanted to get some life in here," it chuckles.

                The ghost's smile shutters open, and the room, cooled by the storm, grows slightly warmer.

                "Me too," it says, nodding.

                You wonder what it will be like, to not wake to an empty house. You think, perhaps, you will like the change.
