        Suddenly, you are awake. The sheets are your own, as is the bed, and the ceiling; all your limbs are in order.

        What woke you up, I wonder?

    <section id="001">
        You roll over, and on your bedside table (old) a digital alarm clock glows green. You did not buy the clock. You are not seventy--or, however old someone must be to buy a digital alarm clock. It came with the house.

        It is 2:55 AM.

    <section id="002">
         You roll over, knocking your alarm clock off the bedside table, facedown. Your room is soft and blue. You walk, barefoot over the bare floor, to the window, and twist the twisty thing that opens the blinds.

         Outside, the only light comes from the streetlamp at the edge of your yard, yellowish orange. The sky is clear of clouds.

	<section id="003">
        You hear rain outside, soft. You stare at the wall, bare of pictures even after a year here, and concentrate. It is hard, when you are sleepy. Finally, you hear the soft scrape of a chair in the kitchen.

    <section id="004">
        You flick the light on in your bathroom.

        It remains dark. A circuit blown in the storm?

    <section id="006">
        You stare at the pale pink walls, waiting.

        You hold your breath.

        You hear the quiet click of glass, across the house.

        <a href="#005">To kitchen via living room</a>

    <section id="005">
        You walk down the dark hallway, footsteps silent on the carpet. Peering into the living room, you can see the lumpy shape of the couch, and the upturned crate that serves as a table.

        No point, really, in having more. Who would you be impressing?

    </section>

    <section id="007">
        You crouch down on the carpet, lay down to peer beneath the couch. Broken glass winks back at you. It looks as though it was swept out of sight.

         <a href="#008">Onward to kitchen</a>
    </section>

    <section id="008">
        Your bare feet are cold on the kitchen tiles. The curtains blow in the wind, speckled with rain, though you don't remember leaving them open.

        Strangely, you can't hear the rain here.

         <a href="#009">"Hello?"</a>  <a href="#010">"Get the hell out here, whoever you are."</a>
    </section>


            <section id="009">
                "Hello?" you say, your voice a shock in the still kitchen. "Is anyone there?"

                Something rustles behind the pantry door.

                <a href="#012">"Listen, this is my house."</a> <a href="#010">"You'll be sorry if you don't show yourself."</a>
             </section>

            <section id="012">
                "Listen, this is my house," you say, holding up your hands, though no one is in evidence.

                Your palms sweat in the cool, still air.

                A soft yellow light shines from under the pantry door. The door clicks open, and something strange and un-solid drifts out: the suggestion of a body, made of clouds and light.

                "I didn't mean to scare you," it says.

                <a href="#014">"What did you mean to do, then?"</a> <a href="#010">"Well, I mean to scare you."</a>
             </section>

             <section id="014">
                 "What did you mean to do, then?"

                 As much as a ghost can look much of anything, it appears sheepish. "The house seemed," it glances at the kitchen, empty of furniture, "abandoned. Good spot for a ghost to set up, if it doesn't want to cause any problems."

                 The ghost's smile is odd, more like a lantern shutter opening, revealing light, than any movement of teeth or muscles.

                 "It seems I was wrong, however," the ghost continues. "My apologies."

                  <a href="#015">"You don't want to haunt someone?"</a> <a href="#010">"Apology not accepted." Punch ghost.</a>  <a href="#016">"What's with all the broken glass, then?"</a>
             </section>

             <section id="015">
                 "Not all ghosts want to be all, you know, wooOOOOOooooOOO."

                 You've never heard a worse ghost noise, in all your life. You say so.

                 The ghost seems to shrug. "I don't like scaring people. It's not a very satisfying after-life, making people miserable."

                 <a href="#010">Punch ghost.</a>  <a href="#016">"What's with all the broken glass, then?"</a>

             <section id="016">
                "What's with all the broken glass, then?"

                "Oh." The ghost shrinks a bit, drifting closer to the floor. There is a sound like marbles jostling in a cup. You realize the ghost is clearing its throat. "Um. I got...scared. The storm. And all. Sometimes telekinesis is hard to control."

                <a href="#017">"You're afraid of storms? Can I do anything?"</a> <a href="#010">"Shouldn't be hard to get rid of you, then." Punch ghost.</a>

             <section id="017">
                 "You're afraid of storms? Can I do anything?"

                 The ghost's light grows warmer, edging into pink. "Oh no! I--I couldn't. Just a place to stay is lovely, if you don't mind."

                 <a href="#010">"Well, you can't stay here. Shoo."</a> <a href="#018">"Sure, you can stay in here. Night."</a> <a href="#019">"Nonsense. Do ghosts drink tea?"</a>

             <section id="018">
                 "Sure, you can stay in here. Night."

                 You turn, and walk back through your living room, down the hallway to your room, where you sleep until morning.

                 In the daylight, your house is empty again. The glass under the sofa has been cleared.

                 "Nonsense. Do ghosts drink tea?"

                 The ghosts drifts closer, seeming perhaps to blink at you. "I'm not sure. I've never tried. I...could give it a shot, I guess." From this close, you can tell that the ghost radiates a small bit of warmth, like a candle flame. "Do you drink tea, when you get scared?"

                 <a href="#020">"Sometimes, yeah." Make tea.</a><a href="#021">"I don't get scared." Make tea.</a>

                 "I don't get scared," you say, and busy yourself making tea.

                 "Oh," the ghost says, hovering near the pantry, and says nothing else.

                 The tea is done quickly, the scent of mint and herbs floating around the kitchen. There are no chairs here, so you take two mugs into the living room and set them on your makeshift coffee table.

                 "Thanks," the ghost says quietly.

                 <a href="#022">"Actually...I do get scared. This helps, though."</a> <a href="#023">"Right, well. Enjoy. Night."</a>

                 "Right, well. Enjoy. Night."

                 You turn, and walk back through your living room, down the hallway to your room, where you sleep until morning.

                 "Sometimes, yeah." You busy yourself making the tea, the ghost floating behind you with apparent interest. Although you can barely hear the rain, here, the ghost flinches with every flash of lightning. 

                 You begin to explain how the tea kettle works, and when the water is hot, you carry two mugs into the living room. The ghost hovers next to you on the threadbare couch.

                 The ghost offers you a wobbly lantern-grin, and hovers beside you on the threadbare couch.
