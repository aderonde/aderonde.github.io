        Suddenly, you are awake. The sheets are your own, as is the bed, and the ceiling; all your limbs are in order.

        What woke you up, I wonder?

        You roll over, and on your bedside table (old) a digital alarm clock glows green. You did not buy the clock. You are not seventy--or, however old someone must be to buy a digital alarm clock. It came with the house.

        It is 2:55 AM.

    <section id="002">
         You roll over, knocking your alarm clock off the bedside table, facedown. Your room is soft and blue. You walk, barefoot over the bare floor, to the window, and twist the twisty thing that opens the blinds.

         Outside, the only light comes from the streetlamp at the edge of your yard, yellowish orange. The sky is clear of clouds.

        You hear rain outside, soft. You stare at the wall, bare of pictures even after a year here, and concentrate. It is hard, when you are sleepy. Finally, you hear the soft scrape of a chair in the kitchen.

        You flick the light on in your bathroom.

        It remains dark. A circuit blown in the storm?

        You stare at the pale pink walls, waiting.

        You hold your breath.

        You hear the quiet click of glass, across the house.

    <section id="005">
        You walk down the dark hallway, footsteps silent on the carpet. Peering into the living room, you can see the lumpy shape of the couch, and the upturned crate that serves as a table.

        No point, really, in having more. Who would you be impressing?

    <section id="007">
        You crouch down on the carpet, lay down to peer beneath the couch. Broken glass winks back at you. It looks as though it was swept out of sight.
