i. fire
aries
listen. i accidentally set myself on fire once.
i was seven and trying to eat a candle.
look. the grass falls to ashes so
easily that i don’t carry matches
anymore.
yes. yes.
the hills shake my hands.

leo
this is a postcard dated august.
it says: come home. i say:
they act like being yourself is a big deal
until you say that your ideal self
is a wizard in a tower with central heat
on a high, tall mountain. then, suddenly,
yourself is “unattainable” and “not serious.”
it’s never “take a magic class
down at the rec center.”
people never say anything useful,
do they?

sagittarius
i want you to remember,
i guess. twist my arm, okay. yes.
but what? the trees, my hands,
the weight of the stars
burning down on the hills.
cross that last part out.
the hills really don’t deserve to burn—
although my high school english teacher
once said that hills always represent women, so,
you know what, fuck’em.
i don’t want to represent anything.
i just want to live there.

ii. earth
taurus
possession is a certain percentage of the law.
the rest, of course, is determination—
for example a determination
that the ghost possessing you will get lost,
and you’ll finally be able to invite someone over
with good taste in beer,
and the ability to pay rent.
like bad company,
all things come around.


virgo
to look is to mistake.
to speak, to misrepresent.
cairn construction requires a firm foundation,
like a home and
we cannot—
i cannot—this message
is cut short.


capricorn
if you write back
in the stars, someday.
if a tower falls
in the woods, someday.
one thousand new paths could be discovered.
one thousand new tricks:
open your hands, and flowers unfold.
you put one in your pocket,
blue flashlight for a dark day.


iii. air

gemini
we are not lies, but truths
misplaced in time.
what i was once, i can no longer be.
and you.
lanterns here burn low,
shuttering from fatigue—breathing is sometimes hard work.
seeing, too. example:
staring into something so strange
that you have to rush out,
barely grabbing matches on the exit run.

libra
the road here leads many places
over the yellow hills, into the sky.
brackets mark it all off, easily selectable.
highlightable.
i remember all of it:
topographical pneumonics.
my pile of flashcards are all trivial
but damn if i don’t win quiz night, every time.
throw me up like a pile of leaves.

aquarius
oh, my love. how we wish it were all true.
but the roads are ice-veiled, now.
accept my letters, and then
breathe me out.
do me the honor.
my best love.


iv. water

cancer
rivers move even when we don’t watch.
i can’t do anything when no one’s watching.
two trees grow on the hillside, green and happy.
i point, say
“that’s us,”
to no one.


scorpio
gentleness was forever lost on us.
a stone in the river,
too small to be rubbed smooth.


pisces
i fade into the red sea,
send you flashcards of my voyage.
after you read them, they burn
like blue flashpaper,
a tiny magic trick just for you.
yes. yes.
hats off.
the captain is far away—
the captain has decided to become a wizard.
the wizard has decided
to love you from very far away.
